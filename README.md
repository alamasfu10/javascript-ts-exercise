# JavaScrit TT Exercise

This small project implements a function and tests it according to these requirements:
> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you mau not use the same element twice.  
**Input:** [2, 7, 11, 15]  
**Target:** 9  
**Output:** [0, 1] (since input[0] + input[1] = target)
